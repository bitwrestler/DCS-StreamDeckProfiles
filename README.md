# DCS-StreamDeckProfiles
Collection of my Stream Deck XL profiles for DCS
I will try to keep these up to date as I change them. They are always a work in progress.

All profiles are for the Stream Deck XL. You can reconfigure them for other devices if you wish. One profile per plane using folders instead of mulitple profiles or pages.

In order to use these, you will need to install [DCS-ExportScripts]([url](https://github.com/asherao/DCS-ExportScripts)) (https://github.com/asherao/DCS-ExportScripts) into DCS and the [Stream Deck DCS plugin]([url](https://github.com/enertial/streamdeck-dcs-interface)) (https://github.com/enertial/streamdeck-dcs-interface). The profiles themselves are installed using the Stream Deck software's import functionality.

FYI: While I tried to use the native DCS plugin for all controls, in some cases that didn't work and I was forced to use HotKey mapping. Some controls on some planes are just really sophisticated.

FYI2: .streamDeckProfile files are really just .zip files. You can open them and see what is inside which will be a collection of JSON and image files.
