# DCS-StreamDeckProfiles
Collection of my Stream Deck XL profiles for DCS
I will try to keep these up to date as I change them. They are always a work in progress.

All profiles are for the Stream Deck XL. You can reconfigure them for other devices if you wish. One profile per plane using folders instead of mulitple profiles or pages. If you are wondering how long it took to do these... ya a long time. I think the A10c was about 30 hours.

In order to use these, you will need to install [DCS-ExportScripts]([url](https://github.com/s-d-a/DCS-ExportScripts)) (https://github.com/s-d-a/DCS-ExportScripts) into DCS and the [Stream Deck DCS plugin]([url](https://github.com/enertial/streamdeck-dcs-interface)) (https://github.com/enertial/streamdeck-dcs-interface). The profiles themselves are installed using the Stream Deck software's import functionality.

* While I tried to use the native DCS plugin for all controls, in some cases that didn't work and I was forced to use HotKey mapping. Some controls on some planes are just really sophisticated.
* .streamDeckProfile files are really just .zip files. You can open them and see what is inside which will be a collection of JSON and image files.
* At some point in 2022 I think the Stream Deck software started doing something different with the DCS Stream Deck plugin reagarding the labels. It used to be that both states would have the same font if you setup the first one. But with some update of the Stream Deck software, that was no longer the case. This results in sometimes the font for the second state being the default font instead of the same as the first state. I"ve been fixing these as I find them.
* A few buttons use a StreamDeck plugin that maps to vjoy so that the StreamDeck button appears to the system as a joystick controller button. If you didn't want to handle all that (installing vjoy of a certain version and the cooresponding StreamDeck plugin for it, you could always remap those to hot keys)
