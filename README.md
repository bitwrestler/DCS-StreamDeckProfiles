# DCS-StreamDeckProfiles
Collection of my Stream Deck profiles for DCS
I will try to keep these up to date as I change them.

In order to use these, you will need to install [DCS-ExportScripts]([url](https://github.com/asherao/DCS-ExportScripts)) into DCS and the [Stream Deck DCS plugin]([url](https://github.com/enertial/streamdeck-dcs-interface)https://github.com/enertial/streamdeck-dcs-interface).

FYI: While I tried to use the native DCS plugin for all controls, in some cases that didn't work and I was forced to use HotKey mapping. Some controls on some planes are just really sophisticated.
